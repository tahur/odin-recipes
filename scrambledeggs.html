    <h4>The right way to scramble eggs. There is more to just mixing eggs and cooking! This will make a believer out of you.</h4>
    <p>When you don't have the time to make a pastry crust, try this quick lunch idea. You may add any other goodies you like, such as ham, chicken, crab, shrimp or broccoli.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon mayonnaise or salad dressing</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon water (Optional)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon margarine or butter</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

        <p>
            In a cup or small bowl, whisk together the eggs, mayonnaise and water using a fork. Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat. Pour in the eggs, and stir constantly as they cook. Remove the eggs to a plate when they are set, but still moist. Do not over cook. Never add salt or pepper until eggs are on plate, but these are also good without.
